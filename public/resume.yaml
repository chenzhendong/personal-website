  aboutMe: >
    I always keep the curiosity on the world and rarely pass up a good opportunity to learn something new. 
    With a tremendously flexible minds, I am able to shift from idea to idea without effort. 
    Not only I can draw strength from the tradition, I can also skip out the path dependency and pull together disparate thoughts from my extensive knowledge base,
    with a little raw creativity to hold these them together, to formulate bold new ideas. 
    Being able to analysis problems from every angle, I have no qualms about putting my enthusiasm and energy to find a solution for some interesting problems.
